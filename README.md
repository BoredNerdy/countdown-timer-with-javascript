# Countdown Timer: Building with JavaScript and CSS
In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating a countdown timer using JavaScript and CSS.

# Setting Up the HTML Structure
To start, we need to set up the basic HTML structure for our countdown timer. Open your preferred text editor and create a new HTML file. Begin by creating a container element where our countdown timer will reside. Give it a unique ID to reference it in our JavaScript later.

# Styling the Countdown Timer with CSS
Now, let’s make our countdown timer visually appealing using CSS. Create a new file named “styles.css” and link it to the HTML file. Apply styles to the countdown container and the individual timer elements. 

# Implementing the JavaScript Logic
To make our countdown timer functional, we’ll use JavaScript to calculate and update the countdown time remaining. Create a new file named “script.js” and link it to the HTML file. We’ll start by defining some variables and a function to initialize the countdown.

# Updating the Countdown Timer Display
Now that we have the initial structure and the countdown logic, let’s update the timer display. Inside the startCountdown function, we’ll calculate the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds and update the corresponding elements in the HTML.

# Adding Additional Functionality
To complete our countdown timer, we need to implement the countdown logic to update the timer every second. We can achieve this by using the setInterval function in JavaScript.
